Outstanding products are what we should aim for â€“ they get referred by users and build a positive bond with your customer.

To reach an outstanding application, it needs to comply with these criteria:

* Optimized UI based on screen size, target platform and user input
* React instantly to user input
* Use animations to highlight important parts of the applications and to improve the UX
* Load data asynchronously and never block the UI thread for a smooth user experience
* Cache data and assets and free the cache when the user does not need it any longer
* Provide offline support and sync the data when the user has internet connection again
* Get notified when there is a new update available Qt provides the basis for cross-platform and cross-device functionality.
